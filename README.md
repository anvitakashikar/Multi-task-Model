# Multi-task-Model
  Multi-task learning (MTL) is a subfield of machine learning where multiple learning tasks are solved simultaneously. By exploiting commonalities and differences across tasks, MTL aims to improve learning efficiency and prediction accuracy compared to training models separately. This approach leverages shared representations, allowing what is learned for one task to benefit other tasks. In practice, MTL can be particularly useful in scenarios where tasks share significant commonalities. MTL allows the solutions to inform each other, enhancing overall performance. MTL is also beneficial for learning unrelated tasks, as the regularization induced by requiring an algorithm to perform well on related tasks can be superior to traditional regularization methods. This makes MTL a versatile and powerful approach in the field of machine learning, capable of improving generalization and performance across a wide range of applications.

Following is the System Architecture of Multi-Task Learnig Model.



  A common approach in MTL is hard parameter sharing, where the initial layers of a neural network are shared across all tasks. This allows the model to learn general, task-agnostic features. Subsequent task-specific layers are then added to handle the unique aspects of each task. Soft parameter sharing techniques, such as regularization and parameter tying, can further encourage parameter sharing between tasks, promoting more efficient learning.

This project is an application of Multi-task Learning Model, 2 tasks (Text Summarization and Text Translation) can be done from the same model.
